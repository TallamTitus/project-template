# My Awesome Project

This is the catchphrase. Make it count.

Here is an additional quick introduction, if necessary.

## Why?

Why does this project exist? Come on, don't delete this part. Fill it.
Yes it's hard, but it's perhaps the most important part of the README.

As to why *this* project exist, it's to serve as a template for future open
source PHP projects. Of course, feel free to fork it and make your own recipe.

## Installation

Describe how to install the project/library/framework/…

Make sure your installation instructions work by testing them!

## Usage

Now let's describe how you can use this project!

For the sake of the example, I will include an unnecessarily explicit code block
because the "Usage" section should contain examples.

So here is how you can use this project as a basis for your own future repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mnapoli/project-template.git my-project
cd my-project
# Remove the git repository metadata
rm -rf .git/
# Start a brand new repository
git init
git add .
```

Easy peasy! Now you just have to code.

Make sure your examples work by testing them! I didn't test mine and I should feel ashamed.

## License

Come on, [choose a license](http://choosealicense.com/) already!

For *this* project, I choose […drumroll…] the [Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/).
